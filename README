/***** Virtual memory written questions *****/

****
 1. Explain how the system establishes the physical location for a virtual address.

 - Virtual memory space is 2^32 bytes.
 - Physical memory space is 2^18 bytes.
 - Page size is 4096 (2^12) bytes.
 - The user process generates the virtual address 0x11123456.

 The page number is the first 20 bits (32-12) of the virtual address and 
 the page offset is the last 12 bits of the virtual address.

 Establishing the physical location uses the Translation Look-aside Buffer hardware.
 1. The page number and offset are separated in the logical address. (hardware)
 2. The page number is sent to the TLB. (hardware)
 3a. If the page number is in the TLB, the frame number is accessed from the TLB. (hardware)
 3b. If the page number is not in the TLB, the frame number must be looked up in
 	 the page table in main memory. (software)
 4. The frame number and offset are added together to obtain the physical address. (hardware)

2. Find the maximum page-fault rate for an effective access time of <=200 ns.
 
 Page fault service times:
 - 8 ms if empty page available or replaced page not modified (occurs 30% of the time)
 - 20 ms if the replaced page was modified (occurs 70% of the time)
 Memory access time:
 - 100 ns

Page faults can add 100 ns (0.0001 ms) on average for 200 ns effective access time.

Average page fault time: 
(8 ms * 0.3) + (20 ms + 0.7) 
= 2.4 ms + 14 ms
= 16.4 ms
= 1.64 * 10^7 ns

Effective access time = access time + (page fault time * page fault rate)
200 ns = [(1 - pf%) * 100 ns] + [(pf%) * (1.64 * 10^7 ns)]
= 200 = 100 - (100 * pf%) + (1.64*10^7 * pf%)
= 100 = (1.64*10^7 - 100) * pf%
= pf% = 0.00000609759

The maximum page-fault rate is 0.00061%.
